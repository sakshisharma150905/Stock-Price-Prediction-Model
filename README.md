# Stock-Price-Prediction-Model


# Summary
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. By leveraging time series forecasting techniques, the model aims to provide insights for investors and traders in making informed decisions. The implementation is done using Python in Google Colab, incorporating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

# Model Overview
This project implements an LSTM model designed to predict future stock prices based on historical trends.
# Key features include:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and normalizing data.
Feature engineering: Creating lag features for improved model accuracy.
Model training: Using an LSTM architecture to learn from the data.
Hyperparameter tuning: Experimenting with batch size, number of epochs, and LSTM units.
# Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): To assess the accuracy of predictions.
Comparisons with other models (e.g., ARIMA) for benchmarking.
